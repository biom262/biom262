Reading map (extended format) from [ lepto_selected_chr_pruned.bim ] 
3107 markers to be included from [ lepto_selected_chr_pruned.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ lepto_selected_chr_pruned.fam ] 
266 individuals read from [ lepto_selected_chr_pruned.fam ] 
266 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
182 cases, 84 controls and 0 missing
214 males, 52 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ lepto_selected_chr_pruned.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 3107 SNPs
266 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.997332
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 3107 SNPs
After filtering, 182 cases, 84 controls and 0 missing
