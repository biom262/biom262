Reading map (extended format) from [ m2.bim ] 
10590 markers to be included from [ m2.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ m2.fam ] 
266 individuals read from [ m2.fam ] 
266 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
182 cases, 84 controls and 0 missing
214 males, 52 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ m2.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Using merge mode 1 : consensus call (default)

2790 markers to be merged from [ lepto_selected_chr_22.bim ]
Of these, 2790 are new, 0 already exist in current data
266 individuals merged from [ lepto_selected_chr_22.fam ] 
Of these, 0 were new, 266 were already in current data
