Reading map (extended format) from [ lepto_selected_chr_17.bim ] 
4885 markers to be included from [ lepto_selected_chr_17.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ lepto_selected_chr_17.fam ] 
266 individuals read from [ lepto_selected_chr_17.fam ] 
266 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
182 cases, 84 controls and 0 missing
214 males, 52 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ lepto_selected_chr_17.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Using merge mode 1 : consensus call (default)
