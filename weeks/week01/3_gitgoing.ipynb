    "## Software Carpentry Git Introductions\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a fantastic intiative led by Greg Wilson called Software Carpentry (SWC) to teach basic Unix/Git/Shell/Python/R/SQL skills to scientists. \n",
    "\n",
    "**For this class, we will follow the git introduction here: http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/**. (Feel free to check out the [other lessons](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) later).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you get to [9. Conflict](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/08-collab.html), the remote repository to use will be https://github.com/biom262/cheatsheets/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## (Do this when you get to \"9. Conflict\" in SWC git intro above) My very own cheatsheet\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will be using this [cheatsheets](https://github.com/biom262/cheatsheets/) repository (\"repo\" for short) to learn `git`. Click on that link and click \"Fork\" (upper right). This will create your very own copy of these files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in your terminal, navigate to your home folder and create a directory where you will keep ALL your github repositories (usually a folder in your home directory like `~/code` or `~/software` or `~/workspace-git` or `~/git-repos`). hint: `mkdir`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clone (make a local copy onto your computer) of your cheatsheets repo from GitHub (the \"remote copy\") with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/username/cheatsheets.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now move into that directory (hint: `cd`) and make sure what you see (hint: `ls`) in the terminal is the same as what you see on the GitHub website.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's practice Git\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a change (aka edit) to a file in your cloned repo and save the change locally. For example, you could add a UNIX command that you learned that was particularly helpful.\n",
    "2. Type `git status` in the terminal to see what's up. Type `git diff` to get a detailed list of differences. Use `j` and `k` to navigate up and down the diff, and `q` to end the diff.\n",
    "3. Type `git commit -am \"message for the commit\"` to create a new commit\n",
    "  - Look, `git` is teaching you life lessons like overcoming fear of commitment :)\n",
    "4. Type `git status` to see what's up.\n",
    "5. Type `git push` to push your changes up to the github server.\n",
    "6. If you made a change to the README.md file, you should see it changed on your fork's github page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branching\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're working on some code and you want to extend what you've worked on, but you **REALLY SUPER** want to make sure you didn't break what you already have. After all, you worked really hard on it! Thankfully, `git` has exactly what we need: \"branching\", which is accomplished by creating \"branches.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"branch\" is a concept in git where you want to work on some part of the repository, but you don't want to break what's already there. A branch lets you have your cupcakes and eat them, too, because `git` stores all of the branches at once and you can switch between them!\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Type `git branch` to list out the current local branches\n",
    "8. Type `git checkout -b newbranch` to create a new branch\n",
    "9. Make a commit onto the branch, and push the changes up to github.\n",
    "   Note: You will need to use the branch name in the push, e.g. if my branch is called `smallchange`, I would push via `git push origin smallchange`\n",
    "  - BONUS: Make a merge conflict! Make *another* branch and edit the `README.md` file. Now make **another** branch and edit the `README.md` file *on the same line*. Try to push both branches. You should get a merge conflict. This is good. See, git is teaching you yet another life lesson: dealing with conflict!\n",
    "10. You should see your new branch up on your fork's github page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's make a Pull Request\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use your branch from the previous section to add onto the `cheatsheets` page. If you don't like that change, feel free to make a different one on a new branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a pull request back to the original repo that you forked by going to \n",
    "   your `cheatsheets` repo website (`http://github.com/username/cheatsheets`),\n",
    "   and pressing the green \"compare\" button next to the branches, which looks \n",
    "   like this: ![](http://i.imgur.com/xKzb8v7.png)\n",
    "  - BONUS: Look at your contribution and the rest of your class! On the [`biom262/cheatsheets`](https://github.com/biom262/cheatsheets) page, click where it says \"(##) Contributors\" (where ## is some number). Then click \"Network\" which will show you the literal graph network of everyone that has ever forked this repo and pushed any changes to github. Pretty cool!\n",
    "2. And that's how you contribute to open source software! Wasn't that easy?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Read the remaining sections of the Git intro from Software carpentry\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read sections 10-12 from Software Carpentry's [Git intro](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## You're done!\n",
