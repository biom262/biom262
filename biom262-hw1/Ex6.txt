In the paper by Wong et al.,authors found that NF-KB binding was enriched at 11 mers across genome. Our analysis gave us larger DNA segments out of which many were repeats and overlaps. This means that the annotation lacks precision. Regions marked as NF-KB binding sites need to be refines to a narrow sequence range. It could be extrapolated that the Chr22 file which we used for fetching gene annotations might not be precisely annotated too. There may be more/less "transcript" regions, which may have promoters binding to NF-KB. We can find the overlap between their 11mers and our output and see how many match to estimate the quality of our analysis.
