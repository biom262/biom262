    "* Some of the issues people were having during the exercises were because `1` ('one') and `l` (lowercase 'ell') looked alike, or `0` ('zero') and `O` (uppercase \"Oh\") looked too similar. Unfortunately, many default monospace (aka, fixed-width, typewriter-style) fonts aren't designed for writing software and it's hard to tell the difference between these tricky characters. We recommend using a nice monospaced font for your terminal (Terminal on Mac/Linux, Putty/Cygwin for Windows)\n",

    "        * `1` (\"one\")  and `l` (lowercase \"ell\")\n",
    "        * `0` (\"zero\") and `O` (uppercase \"oh\")\n",
