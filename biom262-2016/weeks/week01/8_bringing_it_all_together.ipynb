    "2. Pick one person to be reponsible for exercises 1-3 from `6_tf_binding_promoters.ipynb` (person1) and the the other to be responsible for exercises 4-6 (person2)\n",
    "3. Have person1 create a GitHub repo called `biom262-hw1` and write a short `README.md` file\n",
    "4. Have person2 add a LICENSE file copied from the \"Text of the UC Copyright Notice\" section [here](https://confluence.crbs.ucsd.edu/display/CRBS/Releasing+Open+Source+Software+at+UCSD)\n",
    "5. Collaboratively work on a submitter script called `tf_binding.sh` to TSCC which has all the `##PBS` flags shown in the TSCC Quick Start Guide below, and contribute the lines of code that you are responsible for. Use `git blame tf_binding.sh` to make sure person1 is to \"blame\" for exercises 1-3 and person2 is to \"blame\" for exercises 4-5. The \"blame\" of the remaining file doesn't matter.\n",
    "6. Have person1 add the line: `echo \"Hello I am a message in standard out (stdout)\"` and have person2 add the line `echo \"Hello I am a message in standard error (stderr) >&2\"` (the `>&2` outputs to \"secondary\" aka \"error\" output)\n",
    "7. Have both people `add`, `commit`, and `push` their changes to the server. Are there merge conflicts? How do you solve them?\n",
    "7. Submit your script to TSCC!\n",
    "8. Wait for it to run.\n",
    "9. Check the output. Is it correct? Were the correct files added?\n",
    "9. Add the resulting `.o#####` and `.e#####` (or if you were fancy and redirected your `stdout` and `stderr` to something else then include those files)\n",
    "10. Your final repository should have at least five files:\n",
